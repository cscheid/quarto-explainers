<div id="div-duality"></div>

The duality principle states that the <span class="blue">**smallest**</span> distance from a point
to a convex shape is also the <span class="red">**largest**</span> distance from a point to a
hyperplane tangent to the convex shape.

(Go ahead, drag the black point around.)

```{ojs}
//| output: false
//| echo: false
import { cscheid } from "/js/cscheid/cscheid.js";
import { main } from "./duality.js";
{
  cscheid.setup.setupGlobals({ d3 });
  main();
}
```
