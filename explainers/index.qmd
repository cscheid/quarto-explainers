title: Explainers
---

This is a collection of small explanatory notes and interactive demos. They started
with a focus on data science, but have sprawled into "math and CS explainers".

These notes are probably more informal than what you may be
expecting. If you're looking for textbooks, I'm sure you can find
excellent ones.

## Basics

* [Trigonometry](trigonometry/index.qmd)
* [Linear Regression](linear-regression.qmd)

## Supervised Learning

Methods which use data to make predictions about new, unseen data.

* [Logistic Regression](logistic-regression/index.qmd)
* [Support Vector Machines](svm/index.qmd)
* [Error-correcting output codes](error-correcting-output-codes/index.qmd)
* [$k$-nearest neighbor classification](nearest-neighbors/index.qmd)
* [Perceptron](perceptron/index.qmd)

## Unsupervised Learning

Methods which, given a dataset that has a complex representation,
create simpler versions of the dataset.

* [Principal Components Analysis](pca.qmd)
* [Multidimensional Scaling](mds.qmd)
* [$k$-means](kmeans/index.qmd)

## Linear Algebra

* [Singular Value Decomposition](svd.qmd)
* [Adjoints and Inverses](adjoints-and-inverses.qmd)
* [Eigenwhat?](eigenvectors/index.qmd)

## Other

* [Regularization](regularization/index.qmd)
* [A simple illustration of duality](duality.qmd)
* [Convolutions](convolution/index.qmd)
* [Automatic Differentiation](automatic-differentiation/index.qmd)

## Data visualization

* Function fitting and reconstruction:
  * [B-Splines](b-splines/index.qmd). Intro to B-Splines.
  * [Linear Function Spaces](linear-function-spaces/index.qmd). Brief
    intro to using linear function spaces and reconstruction kernels to
    represent continuous functions in a computer.
