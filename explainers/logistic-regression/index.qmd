# Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is one of the simplest ways to build
*classifiers*: models that predict binary outcomes (in contrast to
[regression models](../linear_regression.html), which predict numerical
values).

## Why Logistic Regression?

There are many ways to ask the question "why logistic
regression?". One natural question to ask is: if we already know how
to build linear regression models, but now are trying to build
classifiers, why not simply use a linear regression model and round
the prediction to a binary value?
