title: "Padé Approximants"
from: markdown+emoji
---

tl;dr: instead of approximating something with a polynomial (something like
Taylor series), we approximate it with a rational
function. Presumably this works better when your function has a pole,
because you can match the pole of the function to the pole of the
rational approximation. 

Supposedly these approximations also work better than Taylor series
for the same order of polynomial/rational function. That shouldn't be
surprising, since polynomials are a subset of rational functions.

Obviously I don't understand them at all so I'm just going to plot some
Padé approximants instead :shrug: :

<div id="pade-approximant"></div>

<script type="module" src="./index.js"></script>
