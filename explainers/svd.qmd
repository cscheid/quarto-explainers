# Singular Value Decomposition

Any matrix $M$ can be written as

$$M = U \Sigma V^T, $$

where $U$ and $V$ are orthogonal, and $\Sigma$ is diagonal with
non-negative entries.

Because orthogonal and diagonal matrices have many convenient
properties, it's often simpler to replace a matrix with its SVD in
order to analyze something.

## Problems

- In the problem of linear least squares, we are given a matrix
  $M$ (whose $n$ rows and $m$ columns encode $n$ data points each with
  $m$ features) and a vector $b$, and we seek a vector $x$ such that
  the length of $||Mx - b||$ is minimized.
